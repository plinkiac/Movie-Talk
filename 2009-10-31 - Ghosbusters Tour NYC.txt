Behind me is the Empire State Building.
A very important building in New York City.
Uh, however, it was non featured prominently in Ghostbusters, so what's the point.
It was in Elf.
Here we are in Central Park.
Let's see what else we can find.
I like Ghostbusters.
"I am Vinz, Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer...Volguus Zildrohoar, Lord of the Seboullia. are you the Gatekeeper?"
"No one steps on a church in my town."
"Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of Spook Central."
Remember when they said that in the movie?
Oh, and here's Times Square.
Well, I don't think I'm gonna find anymore locations today.
Plus, I'm lost.
So, that's the end of the video.
