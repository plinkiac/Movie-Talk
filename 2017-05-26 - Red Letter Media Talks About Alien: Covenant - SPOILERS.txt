why is the original 1979 film called alien when we now know that it wasn't an alien
how did David create alien eggs without a queen alien
why didn't the crew of the Covenant wear space helmets when landing on a weird alien planet, just to be safe
why didn't the crew wait to see if those terrible electrical storms would pass before trying to land on the planet
how come they didn't notice with their spaceship scanners that there is a gigantic alien city within walking distance of where they landed
why wasn't the crew at all suspicious of David a man that shows up looking like an evil wizard and is surrounded by thousands and thousands of dead bodies
coincidence
thanks, ridley scott
I'm surrounded by thousands and thousands of dead bodies every day because I work in a graveyard
why would Waylon create an Android that's hair grew
because he bought stock in the barbershop industry
and how come David cut his hair with scissors but in the next scene that looked perfectly coiffed
he designed a specific alien species that was an alien barber
why did the chest burster hatchling look like a little tiny version of an alien instead of the way that it looked before
it came out of the same looking egg and grew up to be the same looking xenomorph
did somebody forget to watch the old movie just to double-check what it looked like
so the engineers created all life on Earth, then Waylon created David then david created the xenomorph
so why was there a mural of a xenomorph in the caves in prometheus
did David not create the xenomorph
in all of his experimentation he just created a being that looked exactly like one that it already existed
that's a pretty big fucking coincidence
cosmic coincidence
thank you, Ridley Scott
David's original mission was to travel with Waylon to the sequel planet so that Waylon could find immortality
after Waylon died, suddenly David decided to become a Frankenstein man who decides monsters
for no reason at all
it's because David wanted to create the perfect organism
I don't know why he thinks the Xenomorphs the perfect organism
can't talk
it's ugly
and it can't create nothing
creation seems pretty important to David
the xenomorph also can't reproduce without the aid of another species
it also drools way too much
it also can't get an emergency blood transfusion without dissolving all the medical equipment it would need
it also couldn't give me a ride to my shift in Burger King
it also pointlessly and violently attacks everything it sees
these attacks usually result in its own death
how incredibly stupid of it
I'm smarter than a xenomorph 
why did David kill all the engineers with the black goo when he landed on their planet
and how did the black goo turn into an airborne pollen-like substance
is that what happens when it's exposed to air
did David know it was going to do that
why send so many crew members down to check out the mysterious planet that no one's ever heard of before
why not just send the Android down first to take some basic readings
then they'd know if they didn't have to wear fucking helmets
why bother
just roll the dice
the waylon corp knew exactly where waylon was going
why didn't anybody ever travel to that planet to investigate what happened
if they did, they'd find:
a gigantic crashed alien spaceship that fell over on its side
bits and pieces of debris from the exploded prometheus ship
the flattened remains of waylon's daughter
waylon's body 
the bodies of all the people that went with waylon
the dead body of a blue alien and a dead squid
black goo spilt all over
the place a little escape pod that's shot out of the Prometheus it before crashed into the ship
and lots and lots of other clues it's exactly what happened
and don't forget about the little kind of alien creature
what happened to him
did he find a home with a nice family to live with
and then violently attacked them for no reason
the relationship between david and walter was exactly like the relationship between data and lal
if you don't remember who lal was, it was data's daughter
her emotions eventually drove her crazy, and eventually engineered the Borg who would later go on to kill millions of people
wouldn't a better comparison be data and lore
who
thanks, Ridley Scott
in alien versus Predator, the aliens have been coming to earth since at least 2996 BC
but David didn't create the Xenomorphs until 2103
those dates don't line up
I guess the alien versus Predator films aren't canon anymore
I wouldn't worry about it, jay
all these films feel like cannon now
in recent interviews, Ridley Scott said that the reason why the engineers wanted to kill the population of Earth was that 2,000 years ago humans killed Jesus who was an engineer
I guess that answers the question of whether Jesus was white or black
I guess he was blue
thanks, ridley scott
as advanced as the engineers were how did they not detect that the incoming ship only had one Android on it
and was thousands of years old
didn't their spaceship technology advance at all
no
hey, maybe they got their ships exactly how they wanted them
and they didn't need to improve on anything
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
just like the original 1979 film, alien
