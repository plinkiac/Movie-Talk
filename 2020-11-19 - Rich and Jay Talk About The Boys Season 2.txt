well, rich
we're back here again to talk about the boys
aka the homelander show
as it's always been
yeah
less so with this season
the first season, if he wasn't on it, it would not be half as good
yes
uh, and i would say for this season, now that it's over, we're going to talk about it
because they released it weekly, which nobody liked
i guess there was a lot of controversy behind that
yeah, i think people just wanted to binge it, which is understandable
we're, we're taking steps backwards as a society right now, jay, and i think it's very important we address this fact
okay
uh, boys came out
it was releasing weekly, and i thought, i want to binge it, and so i'll just i'll just wait till it's done
and then i stopped thinking about the boys
and then i never went back to it until literally, like, four days ago, you brought it up
and i'm like oh yeah the boys season two exists
yeah
i feel like because the first season came out, and everybody binged it and talked about it all weekend
and it was like trending on twitter and it was like a big deal
mm-hmm
they released it weekly
early on people were like oh the boys is back
and then every week that died down
and i feel like nobody's talking about it even though it just ended like a few weeks ago yeah so
yeah
so
yeah
i think it's, that type, especially a show like that, where it's only eight episodes
it's different than like a regular you know it's like a network show that's on for 22 episodes and that you release weekly
whatever
and you have to sell ads
that's the whole point in dragging it out the way they do
you don't have to do that with the boys
so why release it weekly
well also it's it's it's not like cbs all access or paramount plus or whatever the fuck they're calling it this week
where they have to have a reason for you to keep subscribing
yeah
and it's like uh we put it all at once so just subscribe one week and then they'll leave
oh god
we gotta keep them on the hook
yeah
people have amazon prime they don't have that problem
they didn't need to do this
so i'm, i'm just curious what they were thinking
yeah
i think it was a detriment
i mean, i don't know their numbers of course
so they probably at least when they decided to do it weekly thought they knew what they were doing
whether it paid off i have no idea
but i, i think some shows benefit from weekly like twin peaks the return
there's 18 hours
every week was an hour
and it's weird david lynch shit
so you want to watch that and then have time to process it before the next episode
so that that way actually benefited from being released weekly
this show, it feels like a long movie, and you just want to keep watching it
yeah
in a way where you know there's not a whole lot to process in terms of uh heady esoteric stuff
uh-huh
you just want to see more people explode
unfortunately i did get something fucking spoiled to me because of this
oh, really
because i waited
no, i'm not gonna watch this release
and i saw like a just a a meme of something where um where somebody's face was getting ripped off
okay
which, that means something to me i watch the boys in part because they do shocking dark gory humor
yeah
and i also think cause i did start watching it weekly, uh, for the first few episodes
and then it's like i need to stop this because i watched one episode
by the next week it had kind of left my brain
it's not a show, at least for me, i mean this is probably different for everybody, but for me it's not a show that kind of sticks with you
so if you watch it all at once as if it were a very long movie i think it has more of an impact than going week to week
i don't, i, i don't think, i don't think that's necessarily the case
i think the first three or four episodes of the season were just kind of like a blur
i felt like we're just doing the first season just again and nothing, nothing felt\, nothing stood out to me in those first half of the season
it doesn't open as strong as the first season
yeah
because the first season, i mean, right off the bat you got huey's girlfriend getting obliterated
you've got the the uh with his face the deep, uh, you know doing his sleazy me too stuff to starlight
like it really hooks you right away
yeah
um, and this season, i feel like, and maybe that was by design
because i think as the season goes on it actually gets stronger than the first season
yes
but it takes a while to get there
yes
i uh for the first half of the season just felt like everyone's sitting around in a basement
"christ"
well, yeah
they are
that's literally what they do
i think, i think it's one of my one of my complaints with the series as a whole so far
the boys themselves don't appear to do very much or be very effective
yeah
i mean, like i said, as the season goes along
yeah, yeah
they definitely do
we get there
we get there eventually
i feel like the first half of the season is doing something that would be a complaint about the first season which is the boys themselves
and that includes the the female boy
uh, but yeah kamiko like it it gives all those side characters a little bit more it flushes them out a little bit more
all that like frenchie kamiko all those characters they feel like more well-rounded characters than the first season
yeah
the first season was homelander and butcher
and that's like all the other characters are just in service
huey and starlight
huey a little bit
he's intentionally the everyman
that's his, his role in the show
yeah
he's an easier kind of entrance point into the series
but it was all about homelander and butcher
and this season i feel like everybody else gradually but eventually everybody kind of rises to that level
basically started about like episode four
yeah
"well i think this is going great"
we got, we got a new character
we got, we got stormfront
well she goes along with like i felt this way about the first season and more so with this one
where it's kind of tackling a lot of contemporary issues
it feels very of the time
and some of her dialogue is a little too on the nose
like, she's talking about sjw's and stuff
like whenever you hear stuff like that it just makes you cringe
but the purpose of the character i think is, is well done, where the that aspect of her like of uh intentionally causing outrage on online
yeah
causing arguments and debates online
yeah
it feels very relevant in a way where it's not, it works in service of the story
it doesn't just feel like we're talking about current issue
where it's like that can be kind of cringy sometimes where it's so like hitting you over the head with it
uh huh
and this i think was integrated into the story pretty well
has anyone done that yet
is this the first time we've had a character who's used memes to manipulate the populace
i don't know
it might be
is that something we're just gonna see more and more of in the future
that's just gonna be what villains do from here on out
yeah
well it's tricky because you don't want it to come across as uh like eye rolling
i always just think of george romero
i think of his like, land of the dead, where he's like we're talking about bush
and it's just hitting you over the head with it
or diary of the dead, where he's like the internet exists and he just feels so out of touch
like this this feels like they know what they're doing a little better
i have to log into the internet and hack the mainframe
the mainframe
the mainframe
look, in the boys, it would be the mainframe
okay, yeah
yeah, her and homelander, like it's funny because i never really thought of homelander as being i mean should we just say spoilers
yeah
i think at this point we've talked about it enough
we got our general impressions without spoilers
we'll get into spoilers
spoilers
stormfront is literally a nazi
not just some sort of like troll on twitter
like, she's actually a nazi
like, like she's a hundred years old
she's kind of like a palpatine style of evil
yeah
where she's not like, she's not like grim
she's very, she's very cheerful
she's very happy
yeah
that's the creepiest stuff in the show
especially when they go, stormfront and homelander, uh, start trying to kind of, uh, groom his son 
and they're they're so intimidating and scary while acting cheerful and happy
uh huh
there's like those scenes when they go visit the mother and they're yeah he's showing them like he makes little lego movies on his on his ipad or whatever
just the way they start talking to him, where they're like they're so polite and they're so like cheery but it's so the the underbelly of what they're doing is so creepy
yeah he's a wussy and we have to change that behavior
yeah, yeah
that's, that's, that's, that's an other theme running running through this with uh fathers specifically but parents parents in general turning their kids into monsters
just just like them
yeah
because it's this is what that's what happened to butcher
it's what happened to homelander
yeah
i think it's the last episode or second to last episode where stormfront says, people love what i have to say, they just don't like that word nazi
and you're like oh, it makes my skin crawl
but i love the uh they're making their, their justice league movie
uh just that like aspect of the the the fake corporate uh kind of social justice-y pandering stuff
"girls get it done"
"and cut to rehearsal, no one move, no one move"
oh, the women get it done
girls get it done
yeah
that and then like the uh like pride bars
like they take uh queen maze being a lesbian
and then they market it
they market it
all that stuff
and then the deep, who, he kind of in the first season after he was kind of one of the main inciting incidents of the whole show
and then he kind of went away for a lot of it
this is something okay
this is something garth ennis does
and i i pronounced his name wrong last time
i kept calling him garth eenis
okay
because i've only seen it in print
and i would like to issue a personal apology to garth ennis
and that is presuming your name is pronounced ennis
because i have only heard that i was pronouncing his name wrong last time 
hat doesn't mean i am pronouncing it right now
what if people told you you were pronouncing it wrong just to troll you
that could be it
however your name is pronounced garth ennis and or eenis, i love your work
rich if you really loved him you'd learn how to pronounce his name
can you, can you please send me a voicemail letting me know how to properly pronounce your name
maybe he's on cameo
this is something garth ennis has just done like in preacher
uh i don't know how familiar with preacher
i know of it through you
have you heard of the character arseface
yes
okay
he's a part of the first storyline
kind of like kind of like the deep
you have that whole sexual metoo thing going on
mm-hmm
and then he's kind of out of the main story
but he just hangs around for the entire run of preacher
even though he doesn't interact with anybody else like ever again
it's just every now and then we cut back to arse face
what's he doing
hmm
and that's kind of what they're doing with the deep
i was going to say, i mean, it ties in well they also deal with scientology, which is great
them trying to the company trying to like, uh, lift up his image his public image
the thing though it's not even a parody
no
that's just that's just like a scientology documentary
yeah
so it ties in in the sense that that group is where they get the information that stormfront turns out to be a nazi
but that's really the only connecting tissue
but i liked the deep a lot more in this season
even though he his storyline has almost nothing to do with anything
yeah
just his attempt his pathetic attempt like rehabilitating his his public image was just constantly making me laugh
well he was he was a horrible like sex predator early on in this show
but since then they've just made him so pathetic
so absolutely pathetic that he almost he's almost likeable
yeah
and then he trains kind of in the same boat where he's trying to restore his image
and he's the one that turns over the information that stormfront is a nazi
not because he wants to do what's right but because he just wants to get back into the seven
yeah
so that kind of cynical like humor is is what works best on the show
and i feel like that's they amped that up a lot in the season two more so than the first season
yeah
and we have to address when we talked about cobra kai, i made a comment that i cut out of the episode
well that's at the end of the second season, they teased the return of elizabeth shue
which makes sense because i i doubt they're going to be bringing her back on the boys
i don't think there's going to be a way to bring her character back
the day i was editing that video i watched the new season of the boys, and there she was, and then the curb your enthusiasm music started playing over my life
it's okay jay because she's definitely not gonna show up in the boys anymore
okay
okay
we've we've taken care of that
but that's a fun thing too
all the stuff with homelander being like a sex weirdo is great
using like a shape-shifter superhero to look like elizabeth shue
fucking in a filthy alley while they crush someone's head
drinking drinking breast milk
like homelander is just the best character
the breast milk is the best stuff
he clearly, he clearly has parentage issues
yes, yes
does this does this does this series have to end with him just going completely off the deep end
you have to have some sort, yeah, there should be some sort of major, he just goes apeshit on a crowd of people
he just has to be tearing down buildings in new york and and just
he he he needs to just go to the white house and just like just plop himself down in the oval office and put his feet up on the desk
throw the president out the window
he just declares himself the president
he just declares himself the leader
that'd be great
that's where you could go for the third season
something like that
we should we should you should like bleep that out of spoilers because i'm i'm almost sure they're going to do that
no, we don't bleep it out we say it and then people come back and say you got it right
it's funny when people say that like you guys predicted it you guys always predict stuff
it's like no we're not we're not that smart
you just think a hack
yeah, you just think about, like, well, what's the most obvious thing they'll do
and then that's what they do
homelander, homerlander just just just going completely just just giving up
or not giving up
just saying fuck it
yeah
and just
dropping the facade
what are you gonna do
i'm in the white house
i'm in charge
yeah
that that would be fun 
mm-hmm
well that's that's that there's that through the whole show there's always that that tension where you know what all these superheroes are capable of
and they're just waiting for one of them to go nuts
that's why you need the boys
yes, yes
so they can sit around in a basement
i was just for this series in general when i first heard about it, expecting more like clever ways that just basically bar room brawlers would have to figure out how to take down superheroes
like there's a scene when um frenchie has a flashback
they're recruiting frenchie
yeah
and they mention how he used a bomb to take out a superhero who was powered by his own rage
yeah
i wanted more clever shit like this with this show
that's fair
as it stands i i think this season overall is probably a little bit tonally more consistent than the first season
i think it's a little bit stronger once you get past those first couple episodes
yeah
three or four episodes into season two i thought i was done
yeah
i, i was like oh god i got i have four more episodes of this
that that was
my attitude halfway through the season
oh, that's not good
yeah
but it did it did quickly
yeah
get up
so i think i think overall i like it about as much as season one, but it's really split
uh, and ah
yeah
you gotta slog through the first couple episodes
yeah, yeah
it doesn't even have any really great gore until the second half
yeah, i know
the gore is interesting because i mean there's a scene where just a ton of people explode
and i love it when a whole bunch of people explode
so that's great
and then 30 seconds later we see huey their van flips over
and he comes out with like a shard of glass or metal in him
and you're like ooh
and like being able to balance that between those two completely different types of violence is kind of amazing
when something so extreme happens like people's heads just
pfft!
pfft!
pfft!
like ten heads explode in five minutes, that is, that is so over the top and absurd
mm-hmm
it's it's like surreal and funny
yeah
that's true
it's the fact that one he was a character we know
and the fact that it's not like this huge gory explosion it's just like a simple stabbing, i think
it's something you can connect with more
you can connect with more
made it more real
mm-hmm
yeah
so
but just yeah being able to balance those, because that's this whole show, is the the extremes of incredibly cynical incredibly violent but then also having characters you still care about to an extent
you should you should read some uh garth ennis comics
i don't know how to read, rich
oh
how do you do the credits if you can't read
what
have these cameras always been
